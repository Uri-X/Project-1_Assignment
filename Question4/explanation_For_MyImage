This embedded system is a simple temperature warning light. The TMP36 sensor measures ambient temperature and outputs a voltage proportional to it (10 mV/°C). The Arduino Uno (controller) reads this analog voltage on pin A0, converts it to degrees Celsius using the formula: temperature = (voltage - 0.5) × 100. If the temperature exceeds 30°C, the Arduino sets digital pin 13 HIGH, activating the LED (actuator) as a visual alert. When temperature drops below the threshold, the LED turns OFF. Data flows in a closed loop: physical temperature → sensor → analog signal → controller processing & decision → digital output → actuator response → affects user awareness/environment.
