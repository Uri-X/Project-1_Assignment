The code in Q3.c is a program that uses more than one function and it includes a recursive one.
It has a base case and recursive call and can be resued. It is a fuction of factorial.

One of the advantages of recursion is that it has clean and lean code, which makes it effective for mathematical sequences.
On the contrary, one limitation it has is that is uses more memory and this can lead to stack overflow especailly when the base case is missing.
