## Question 1: C Program Lifecycle and Compilation

**Contents:**

* `calculation.c` – C program performing a calculation with formatted output
* `explanation.txt` – Explanation of:

  * A real-world application of C
  * Syntax vs semantic errors
  * Stages of C compilation

**How to run:**

```bash
gcc calculation.c -o calculation
./calculation
```

---

## Question 2: Control Flow & Repetition

**Contents:**

* `menu_program.c` – Menu-driven program using conditionals, loops, break, and continue
* `sample_output.txt` – Example program execution

**How to run:**

```bash
gcc menu_program.c -o menu
./menu
```

---

## Question 3: Functions & Recursion

**Contents:**

* `functions_recursion.c` – Program demonstrating multiple functions and recursion
* `explanation.txt` – Discussion on recursion advantages and limitations

**How to run:**

```bash
gcc functions_recursion.c -o functions
./functions
```

---

## Question 4: Embedded Systems

**Contents:**

* `embedded_system.c` – Arduino-style C program
* `block_diagram.png` – Sensor–controller–actuator diagram
* `explanation.txt` – Data flow explanation

---

## Question 5: Integration

**Contents:**

* Explanation included in `explanation.txt` or code comments

---

## Notes

* All programs were written in standard C.
* Arduino-style code follows embedded systems conventions.
* Diagrams are provided where required.
