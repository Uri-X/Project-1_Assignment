
Explanation:
In C programming, we see realword applications in Linux and Windows in Operating systems.
Its power is in low-level memory access and high performance output.

The difference between syntax errors and semantic errors is that syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language, 
such as missing semicolons or mismatched parentheses while Semantic errors are erros that occur when the code is syntactically correct but does not produce the intended result,
 such as using the wrong variable or performing incorrect calculations.

C goes through 4 compilation stages: Preprocessing, Compilation, Assembly, and Linking.
Compilation Stages:
1 is Preprocessing: Handles #include and macros. Output: .i (expanded source).

2 is Compilation: Translates C to Assembly. Output: .s (assembly code).

3 is Assembly: Translates assembly to machine code. Output: .o or .obj (object file).

Linking: Combines object files and libraries. Output: .exe (executable).
