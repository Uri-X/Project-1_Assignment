In a real-world system like a smart watch; it has components like Sensors ( to pick on heart rate, accelerometer), Controller (microcontroller) and Actuators which show display, vibration motor. 
That makes it run on limited power, memory, and CPU, so that it can be efficient.
Inside it, the control flow determines when and what the watch does. It uses the If-statements to check if the temperatures are too high and loops to continuously read sensor data.
It has several functions that break the system into small, manageable tasks, which make the code easier to understand and manatain.
